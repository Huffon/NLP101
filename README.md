# NLP 101: a Resource Repository for Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing
This document is drafted for those who have enthusiasm for Deep Learning in natural language processing. If there are any good recommendations or suggestions, I will try to add more.

_This document is drafted with the rules as follows:_
- Materials that are considered to cover the same grounds will not be recorded repeatedly.
- Only one among those within similar level of difficulty will be recorded.
- Materials with different level of difficulty that need prerequsite or additional learning will be recorded.
